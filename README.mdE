# 🛒 E-Commerce Database Schema

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a **PostgreSQL database schema** for a professional e-commerce system.  
It defines the structure needed to manage users, products, orders, payments, and categories efficiently.

## 🧩 Database Structure
**Main Tables:**
- **Users:** Manages customers and administrators.
- **Categories:** Organizes products into logical groups.
- **Products:** Stores product data including price, stock, and description.
- **Orders:** Tracks customer orders and their statuses.
- **Order_Items:** Links products to specific orders.
- **Payments:** Records payment transactions and methods.

## 🗄️ Entity Relationship (ER) Logic
- A **user** can have multiple **orders**.  
- Each **order** contains several **order items**.  
- Each **order item** references a **product**.  
- Each **product** belongs to one **category**.  
- Each **order** has a related **payment record**.

## ⚙️ How to Use
1. Install PostgreSQL.  
2. Create a new database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_db;
